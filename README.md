# Text Summarization using Transformer
Dataset: https://cs.nyu.edu/~kcho/DMQA/<br>
## Abstract
Highlights are a good low-level overview of a news article, but they are not a concrete synopsis. We hope to build a summary generating system with this project that can convey the most relevant information in a few sentences. This project can help two sorts of users: those who want to digest a particle news item as soon as possible, and those who want to follow news via digital media but are concerned about gazing at a screen for an extended period. This program benefits users who have the means and ability to utilize the internet to read news items. This initiative might serve as a supplement to a digital news publication.<br>
Users will navigate through summaries of digital news items on the User Interface. If the user wishes to learn more about the story after reading the summary, they can click on the article to continue reading. We do not see any concerns with this app's trust or privacy at this time because the user selects whether to read the complete narrative based on the summary supplied.<br>
